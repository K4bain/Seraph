/**
 * Reason explaining why a data-query result is empty.
 *
 * - plugin_not_streaming: the requested pluginId is absent from the engine
 *   /manifest, or its snapshot fetch returned null (plugin not loaded / offline).
 * - no_data_matches: the plugin is streaming but 0 entities matched the
 *   query / region / filters.
 * - no_session_active: the authenticated user has no active globe session.
 *   This value is emitted by the tool layer (which has access to userId),
 *   NEVER by the service layer.
 *
 * NOTE: data-query tools (search_entities, get_entities_in_region, get_entity_details,
 * get_plugin_data) must NEVER emit no_session_active -- they are session-independent.
 * Only session-required command/filter tools may produce this reason.
